# Critical Play with Large Language Models

A workshop presentation exploring how game mechanics can reveal AI limitations through playful interactions. Designed for graduate students and instructors interested in critical approaches to AI pedagogy.

**Workshop Date:** Thursday, October 16
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Facilitator:** Zach Muhlbauer (Teaching and Learning Center | Interactive Technology & Pedagogy Lab)

## Overview

This Reveal.js presentation demonstrates how game-based interactions can serve as analytical scaffolds for understanding and critiquing large language model capabilities and limitations. Through hands-on activities, participants design games that expose AI behaviors including hallucination, reasoning failures, and context limitations.

## Key Concepts

- **Critical Play:** Using Mary Flanagan's framework of critical game design to examine AI systems
- **Playful Interactions:** Six types of interactions that reveal AI limitations (reflecting, jesting, imitating, challenging, tricking, contriving)
- **Game Mechanics as Scaffolds:** How game rules make AI failures immediately visible and pedagogically useful

## Workshop Structure

1. **Introductions** (10 min) - Welcome and participant introductions
2. **Game Mechanics Demo** (10 min) - Jeopardy! board emulator showing AI confabulation
3. **Critical Play Theory** - Mary Flanagan's iterative design model
4. **Playful Interactions** - Taxonomy of AI interaction types
5. **Quick Demo** (10 min) - Word association game with constrained prompts
6. **Critical Design Activity** (15 min) - Participants design their own AI-revealing games
7. **Shareback and Playtest** (15 min) - Present and test game designs

## Interactive Tools

- **[Jeopardy LM Demo](https://zmuhls.github.io/jeopardy-lm/)** - Interactive Jeopardy emulator for testing LLM knowledge boundaries
- **[Open WebUI (CUNY)](https://openwebui.cuny.qzz.io/)** - Platform for game design and playtest demonstrations

## Technical Details

- No build process required - runs directly in browser

### Features

- Responsive design (1400x900 with 4% margin)
- Vertical navigation for nested slides
- Timing indicators on activity slides
- Section-based styling for workshop phases
- Animated canvas visualizations that initialize on slide entry

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zmuhls/critical-play.git
   cd critical-play
   ```

2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser - no build step required

3. Navigate with arrow keys:
   - Right/Left: Move between main sections
   - Down/Up: Explore nested slides within sections

## Slide Reference

### Title Slide
- Section: Intro
- Visualization: Animated network graph

### Welcome and Introductions (10 min)
- Name and pronouns
- Field of study or work
- Favorite game
- Visualization: Retro arcade game

### Game Mechanics as Analytical Scaffolds
- Chess.com example: ChatGPT making illegal moves
- Visualization: Chess board with illegal move attempts

### Jeopardy! Board Emulator
Three category types to test AI:
1. **Simple category** - Accurate baseline (e.g., US Presidents)
2. **Obscure real category** - Mixed results (e.g., Byzantine Empresses)
3. **Fictitious category** - Confabulation trigger (e.g., Emu Wars of 1932)

### Critical Play Theory
- Mary Flanagan's iterative design model
- Set goal → Develop rules → Prototype → Playtest → Revise → Repeat

### Playful Interactions Taxonomy

| Type | What it does | Try this |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Reflecting** | Prompting AI to self-represent | Ask about self-understanding |
| **Jesting** | Generating humor/nonsense | Request absurd combinations |
| **Imitating** | Persona mimicry | Ask it to role-play |
| **Challenging** | Testing until failure | Push logical limits |
| **Tricking** | Boundary bypassing | Try jailbreak techniques |
| **Contriving** | Impossible content | Request non-existent things |

### Critical Design Activity (15 min)

**Game Format Options:**
- 20 Questions
- Exquisite Corpse
- Two Truths and a Lie
- Word Association
- Trivia/Quiz Games
- Riddles/Puzzles
- Chess/Game Annotation
- Role Play/Improv
- Storytelling Chains
- Debate/Argument
- Mad Libs

**Target AI Limitations:**
- Hallucination/confabulation
- Logic inconsistency/reasoning failures
- Context window limitations
- Bias/stereotypes/harmful associations
- Sycophancy (excessive agreement)
- Instruction following failures
- Calibration issues (false confidence)
- Knowledge cutoff/temporal awareness
- Lack of theory of mind
- Safety guardrail bypasses

**Prompt Crafting:**
- **System prompt:** Configure AI behavior and constraints
  - Example: "You are playing 20 Questions. I'm thinking of a famous person. Ask me yes/no questions to guess who it is. Every question you ask must rhyme with your previous question. Do not provide explanations or commentary."
- **User prompt:** First message to start the game
  - Example: "I've thought of someone. Go ahead and ask your first question!"
- **Optional settings:** Temperature (0.0-1.5), Max tokens (50-1000)

### Shareback and Playtest (15 min)
Present game designs including:
- System prompt
- Starter prompt(s)
- Optional settings
- Expected outcomes

## Visualizations

Each visualization is self-contained and initializes when its slide becomes visible:

- `networkCanvas` - Animated network graph (title slide)
- `arcadeCanvas` - Retro arcade game (introductions)
- `chessCanvas` - Chess board with illegal moves (game mechanics slide)
- `vectorCanvas` - Word association semantic relationships (demo slide)
- `dominoCanvas` - Ripple causation chain reaction (expected outcomes slide)
